# NBHM (Non-blocking hash map)

This is an implementation of Cliff Click's Non-blocking hash map, and a hash set version made with the same ideas. It's capable of doing put, get and removal concurrently alongside any potential resizes, that's right you could be resizing while another thread is still looking up entries.
